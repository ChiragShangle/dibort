Although different currencies can be traded anytime you wish, a trader cannot monitor a position for such long periods of time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 24px; color: rgb(52, 64, 85); font-family: Lato, sans-serif;">This implies that there will be Forex trading times when opportunities are missed, or even worse, when a jump in market volatility leads the spot to move against a set position when the trader is not nearby. In order to reduce such a risk, a trader has to be aware of when the market is most commonly volatile, and therefore decide what times are best for their individual trading strategy and trading style.</p>
